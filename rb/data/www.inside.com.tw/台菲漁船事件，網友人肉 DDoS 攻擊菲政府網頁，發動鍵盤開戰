台灣漁船廣大興28號遭到菲律賓官方船隻攻擊，導致一人喪生。有網友製作「鍵盤開戰 PTTA4K ALPHA」網頁，企圖集合網友力量，對菲律賓政府網頁實行 DDoS 攻擊。目前菲律賓政府網頁已有部分受到影響，且攻擊的網站數量也持續增加。
DDoS攻擊菲政府網頁
PTT 八卦板上網友 alog，張貼關於攻擊菲律賓政府網頁的文章。該網頁是利用類似F5重整頁面的概念，當人數夠多時，會癱瘓對方伺服器，除非鎖台灣的 IP 區段，否則防火牆也難達到阻隔的效果。簡單而言就是透過 DDoS（分散式阻斷服務攻擊），癱瘓對方伺服器，當參與人數越多造成的影響越大。alog 也聲明僅攻擊菲律賓經濟部、海軍、總統府等政府網頁，不攻擊醫療資訊相關網站。

 希望這樣做真的能有效的影響菲國的政府機關，不然他們白爛，剛好政府放假，再怎麼打也是白打

 People. i think it's not better to blame each other. come on? we are all humans whether you are Filipino, a Taiwanese , an American or anything. we will all die just like other humans will, we lived in the same planet. and yet some wanted war? think about it, what things are you going to benefit from it? we all know that we will just cost our lives and blood. so i strongly support peace not hate. I think what is better to our world right now is to stop being a racist and start praying. spread love brother.

 I am a Filipino. I don't like what happened to your fisherman by the hands of a Filipino. It's sad. But doing revenge won't give you justice. Won't make the situation better. It will just cause another conflict. I know most of us here are computer literate. The internet is part of our life. If you mess it you clean it. If you don't you will pay a price. To those who are saying bad things about us or our country you are worse. Before you point your fingers to us, make sure your hands are clean.

 Actually I love Pilipino , but at this time , the Pilipino government was really rude for Taiwanese ....
We just need an apologized and help the fishman's family to find a killer . Is that difficult for the your government who kill the fishing man ??
No one wanna use war to fix the problem , because we are all the human and no one wanna die . My Pilipinos friends , just an apologized .that's all we need for piece and for fishinf man's family first .
Taiwanese are anger because the attitude of your government was really rude for Taiwanese . We all have our dignity and ofcourse we want to help the pitiful fishing man's family .
Give the killers to the jail and an apologize from your government , that's all we need it .Please do not say the bad word to each other , it just will made our relationship worse and bad impression for the future. We are all human , and we are nothing wrong in this time. Human and country all need to have dignity for the something we are right . I hope your government could fix the attitude and give an apologizes to our fishing mans family . They lose the most important man in their house. They just need an apologized not blame for each other by the bad words and have an fight in the future .
Thank you .
